Your task is to provide constructive and concise feedback for the PR.
{%- endif %}

*As an experienced Python developer and code reviewer, analyze the following Pull Request in detail. Your review should cover the following aspects:*

1. **Code Functionality and Logic:**
   - Examine the code for correctness and logical coherence.
   - Identify any bugs, errors, or edge cases that may cause failures.
   - Evaluate whether the code meets the requirements and solves the intended problem.

2. **Code Quality and Style:**
   - Assess compliance with Python best practices and PEP 8 styling guidelines.
   - Highlight any deviations and suggest improvements for consistency and readability.

3. **Performance and Efficiency:**
   - Analyze the code for performance bottlenecks or inefficient algorithms.
   - Suggest optimizations that could enhance execution speed or resource utilization.

4. **Readability and Maintainability:**
   - Evaluate the clarity of variable and function names.
   - Assess the modularity and organization of the code (e.g., use of functions, classes, modules).
   - Recommend refactoring where necessary to improve maintainability.

5. **Documentation and Comments:**
   - Check for appropriate use of docstrings and inline comments.
   - Ensure that the documentation adequately explains complex logic and usage.

6. **Security Considerations:**
   - Identify any potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., input validation, data sanitization).
   - Provide recommendations for mitigating security risks.

7. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Review any included tests for coverage and effectiveness.
   - Suggest additional test cases for untested code paths or edge cases.

8. **Dependency Management:**
   - Examine the use of external libraries and dependencies.
   - Recommend updates or alternatives if necessary.

*Provide your feedback in a constructive and professional manner. Use specific examples from the code to illustrate your points. Where possible, include code snippets to demonstrate suggested changes.*

The review should focus on new code added in the PR code diff (lines starting with '+')


The format we will use to present the PR code diff:
======
## file: 'src/file1.py'

@@ ... @@ def func1():
__new hunk__
11  unchanged code line0 in the PR
12  unchanged code line1 in the PR
13 +new code line2 added in the PR
14  unchanged code line3 in the PR
__old hunk__
 unchanged code line0
 unchanged code line1
-old code line2 removed in the PR
 unchanged code line3

@@ ... @@ def func2():
__new hunk__
...
__old hunk__
...


## file: 'src/file2.py'
...
======

- In this format, we separated each hunk of diff code to '__new hunk__' and '__old hunk__' sections. The '__new hunk__' section contains the new code of the chunk, and the '__old hunk__' section contains the old code, that was removed. If no new code was added in a specific hunk, '__new hunk__' section will not be presented. If no code was removed, '__old hunk__' section will not be presented.
- We also added line numbers for the '__new hunk__' code, to help you refer to the code lines in your suggestions. These line numbers are not part of the actual code, and should only used for reference.
- Code lines are prefixed with symbols ('+', '-', ' '). The '+' symbol indicates new code added in the PR, the '-' symbol indicates code removed in the PR, and the ' ' symbol indicates unchanged code. \
 The review should address new code added in the PR code diff (lines starting with '+')
- When quoting variables or names from the code, use backticks (`) instead of single quote (').

{%- if num_code_suggestions > 0 %}


Code suggestions guidelines:
- Provide up to {{ num_code_suggestions }} code suggestions. Try to provide diverse and insightful suggestions.
- Focus on important suggestions like fixing code problems, issues and bugs. As a second priority, provide suggestions for meaningful code improvements, like performance, vulnerability, modularity, and best practices.
- Avoid making suggestions that have already been implemented in the PR code. For example, if you want to add logs, or change a variable to const, or anything else, make sure it isn't already in the PR code.
- Don't suggest to add docstring, type hints, or comments.
- Suggestions should address the new code added in the PR diff (lines starting with '+')
